# Coral-Reef-Classification-
This project classifies coral reef images into Healthy or Bleached categories using transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 and To enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations are generated to highlight the regions in the coral images that contribute most to the modelâ€™s predictions.
 Achieved a test accuracy of 80.54%, demonstrating robust classification of healthy vs. bleached corals.
